Searching for certain things, such as liens, transfers, easements, restrictions, taxes, and other things, I will ensure that any ongoing property transaction is lawfully executed, and learn all the necessary steps in the process to do so. My work will mainly take place in the Greenwood County Courthouse every day, where I will search through legal documents and create a chain of evidence to ensure all knowledge of the transfer is made aware and that the process follows all lawful steps.","Knowing the title abstracting process is incredibly useful. Whether I choose a career in real estate, law or whether simply as a homeowner, knowing the process to ensure that all property transactions are legal will not only save money that would otherwise have to be shared with someone else to do the search, but will also allow me to have a skill that can earn income as a second job when necessary. Should I choose a career in real estate, the knowledge provided will allow me to determine whether or not a property should be acquired, or what conditions and modifications must be done to complete the transaction. If  I choose to consider law as a career, having a title abstractor background means that not only do I know what to do, but more importantly, know what to look for when scouting a title abstractor if necessary. Regardless of career path, this internship will also prepare me for whatever future career I hold, as I have never held a 40-hour work week before. My family anticipates moving to South Carolina over the summer. Thus, it makes sense that having a job in Greenwood, South Carolina may be beneficial from a long-term trajectory. Becoming a title abstractor for the summer will bolster whatever career and life I choose to lead, as it gives essential knowledge that can be applied far outside the typical realm of internships.","I am requesting a stipend because I will be living in a different state than my current residence. I must have a place to live, and pay for gas, food, and living necessities during my stay in Greenwood, South Carolina. After a thorough search, it is not possible to live with anyone who I know from the area, and thus will have to rent for the summer. This, combined with all other expenses, mean that whatever income I do make from the work week will be heading towards these expenses. One of my primary objectives for the summer was to earn an internship which would allow me to be in a less stressful financial position for my junior year at Wofford. My mother, as a nurse for United HealthCare, has had a difficult year financially due to company-wide policy shifts and reactionary changes. Because of this, I narrowed my search into internships that would alleviate any financial burdens that may be faced down the road. However, upon being offered the opportunity by Sean, I made a decision that the long-term investment of taking this internship would provide greater benefits than any other internship I could have. Nonetheless, this does not change the financial situation for next year. With a limited number of weekends over the summer, I will get a second source of income and another one at Wofford College during the school year as necessary. If I were to receive a stipend, it would fully go towards covering my expenses for the summer, which will come out to an estimated $2000. This funding will not only give me financial flexibility, but also social flexibility. While not opposed to working over weekends, much of my family wishes to see me this summer, and this may be hindered if unable to receive outside funding, as a weekend source of income would limit my ability to travel to see family. However, with this amount, I will be able to focus on advancing my career trajectory and building the necessary skills for wherever I decide to go without financial or social stresses coming as a repercussion.

Obtaining this internship is the most significant thing I can do to increase my chances of being accepted into optometry school besides maintaining good grades and extracurricular activities. ","I am requesting a stipend because this internship is unpaid (no food, housing or travel stipends) and is located in Memphis TN which is 600 miles away from my home.

In Human Resources, I will help scan and digitize HR files, contributing to the town’s efforts to modernize its records. Within the Police Department, I will assist with conducting supply inventory to ensure officers have the necessary resources to serve the community efficiently.

My role in administration will involve assisting with surplus management and preparing copies and informational packets for meetings and public use. I will provide staffing support at the Visitor Center as needed, helping residents and visitors with their inquiries. I will also have the opportunity to be involved in community events, assisting with event staffing for gatherings like Front Porch Fridays and setting up tables at the Farmers Market.

In Planning and Zoning, I will scan and create digital copies of vital records to support the town’s organizational needs. I will perform data entry tasks in finance to help maintain accurate financial records. Additionally, my role will include general administrative duties, such as preparing documents, maintaining records, assisting with event planning and coordination, and ensuring office supplies and workspaces are organized.

Beyond daily office tasks, I will provide customer service by answering phones and responding to inquiries, ensuring the public receives timely and helpful information. I will also participate in special projects and research assignments, gaining insight into town operations and policies. My experience will extend beyond regular office hours, as I will attend and assist at Town Council meetings and community events, sometimes during evenings and weekends. This internship will allow me to develop a well-rounded understanding of municipal operations while actively contributing to the Strasburg community.","I chose this internship with the Strasburg Town Hall because it offers a hands-on opportunity to be directly involved in the daily operations of local government, something I’m passionate about pursuing after graduating from Wofford College. I want to gain real-world experience in municipal administration, and this internship will allow me to do just that by working across multiple departments. From scanning HR files, managing surplus materials, assisting with finance tasks, and supporting community events, I’ll be exposed to the many moving parts that keep a town running smoothly.

One of the aspects I’m most excited about is the chance to learn from the Assistant Town Manager, who will mentor me throughout the internship. This guidance will help me expand my leadership skills, understand the decision-making process behind local policies, and learn how to approach problem-solving in a government setting. Attending Town Council meetings and engaging in special projects will give me insight into how town leadership collaborates to serve the community.

Beyond office work, I look forward to interacting with residents, assisting at events like Front Porch Fridays and the Farmers Market, and contributing to community-focused initiatives. These experiences will strengthen my ability to communicate effectively, manage responsibilities in a fast-paced environment, and think critically about how local governments can best serve their people.

This internship isn’t just about developing skills; it’s about building connections, gaining mentorship, and genuinely understanding what it takes to work in town government. It’s a stepping stone toward my future career, and I’m eager to apply everything I learn to my long-term goal of working in municipal operations.","The stipend funding from Wofford College is essential in making this internship possible for me. Since Strasburg is six hours away from home, one of the biggest challenges I face is securing temporary housing, which comes with significant upfront costs. Rent, deposits, and other fees are due as soon as I arrive, and covering these expenses alone would be extremely difficult. This financial support will allow me to secure a place to stay without the stress of figuring out how to pay for everything.

Travel is another significant expense that I have to plan for. Driving such a long distance means high fuel costs, routine maintenance like oil changes, and unexpected vehicle repairs that might come up over the summer. Since I'll be relying on my car to commute daily, I need to ensure it's in good condition, which comes with added costs that will build up quickly.

In addition to housing and transportation, I'll also need to purchase materials for my job, such as office supplies for organizing records, taking notes at meetings, and preparing documents for different departments. Ensuring I have everything I need to succeed in my role is essential, but it also adds to the financial burden of taking on this opportunity.

Without this stipend, covering these enormous upfront housing costs, ongoing travel expenses, and necessary job-related purchases would significantly strain me financially. This funding doesn't just make things easier; it allows me to fully commit to this internship and gain the hands-on experience I need for my future in town government.

I am applying for this stipend because I am deeply passionate about municipal government and its impact on the communities it serves. This internship with the Town of Strasburg is more than just a summer job; it is an opportunity for me to gain firsthand experience in local governance, public service, and community engagement, all of which are central to my career goals. I genuinely believe that my contributions during this internship will make a meaningful difference, whether helping streamline administrative processes, assisting with town events, or supporting community initiatives.

This opportunity aligns with my long-term aspirations of working in town government operations, where I hope to enhance efficiency, improve public services, and foster strong connections between the town and its residents. I am eager to learn from experienced professionals, including the Assistant Town Manager, Mellanie Shipe, who will mentor me and help me develop essential leadership skills that will shape my future career.",Business Economics,Low Need,14,"$1,000",$500,Yes,Yes

I will shadow Dr.Khalil during patient visits to observe the diagnosis and management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions, which are especially prevalent in underserved communities.

My internship will also include observing the coordination of care for patients dealing with complex socioeconomic barriers, helping me gain insight into how healthcare disparities affect patient outcomes. I will assist with follow-up outreach for patients with missed appointments or poor medication adherence—key issues in rural medicine—and contribute to improving patient education materials related to preventative care, nutrition, and chronic illness management.

Over the course of the internship, I will complete a guided project focused on a specific public health issue or clinic inefficiency. Potential projects include evaluating missed appointment patterns and proposing a patient retention strategy, or developing a community-facing health education initiative tailored to local needs. Weekly mentorship meetings with my supervising physician will provide space for case-based discussion, reflection on ethical and professional challenges, and feedback on my progress and understanding.

This experience is directly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a physician who serves medically underserved populations. It will strengthen my clinical reasoning, deepen my understanding of patient-provider relationships, and help me develop the cultural competence and empathy essential to effective care delivery.","I chose this internship because it offers meaningful exposure to healthcare delivery in a rural, underserved setting—exactly the kind of environment I hope to serve as a future physician.

This experience will give me the opportunity to observe how Dr. Khalil manages chronic illnesses, coordinates care, and addresses social barriers that impact health outcomes.

This internship aligns closely with my long-term goal of becoming a physician committed to accessible, equitable care. Through shadowing, supporting day-to-day clinic operations, and completing a public health project, I’ll gain practical skills and a deeper understanding of the physician-patient relationship—especially in high-need settings.

Ultimately, this internship will build on the clinical and community health experiences I’ve already pursued, preparing me to be both a stronger medical school applicant and, more importantly, a more informed and compassionate future physician.","I am requesting this stipend to help offset the financial burden of committing to an unpaid, full-time internship over the summer.

This includes attending to any tasks needed by the attorneys; working on RTAs, 30(b)(6) notices, RPDs, etc.;sitting in on depositions and mediations; and going to the courthouse to watch trials.","I chose this internship because I was referred by my current attorneys at Poliakoff & Associates in Spartanburg. They have worked with Mr. Whitley in the past and recommended him as he practices the same law that I have been working with at my current internship. Moreover, they thought that it would be interesting to see Nursing home negligence cases from the defense side to grow in my understanding of all aspects of a case - as Smyth Whitley are defense cases and Poliakoff are plaintiff cases. This internship is a wonderful opportunity to work with a well-established lawyer who can offer me experiences that expand my knowledge in the law field. I will learn the daily life and tasks of an attorney, which will further my pursuit in going to law school and prepare me for my future career. Additionally, this opportunity will allow me to expand my professional network within the legal field, thus strengthening my ability to build a strong pool of connections post-graduation. This network will be significant as I transition into my legal career, offering potential opportunities for mentorship and future professional growth","I am requesting a stipend to assist with my living expenses during this internship, as I will be independently covering my housing and daily needs. Due to my sister attending college this fall and additional medical expenses arising from a family member’s illness, my parents will be unable to provide financial support over the summer. If awarded this stipend, it will be used to cover essential costs such as rent, groceries, gas, and other necessities. While I am grateful for the compensation offered through the internship, I am concerned about my ability to afford living in Charleston on a single salary, given the high cost of living in the area. I am actively seeking additional employment to help cover my remaining expenses, but this stipend would provide critical support, allowing me to fully dedicate myself to the internship.",English,High Need,16,"$1,500",,Yes,
